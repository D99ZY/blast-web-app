# What is blast?
With blast you have an easy and fair way of letting your friends choose the music at your party. Simply put on a spotify playlist and let your friends vote when to skip a song.

Create a room to start hosting your party. After signing in to your Spotify account, decide how many of your friends need to vote before a song is skipped. Additionally, you can choose whether or not your friends are able to pause the music.

Once the party host has created a room, just ask for the room code. Join the room using the room code to start taking control of the music!
